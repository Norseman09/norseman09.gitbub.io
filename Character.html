            <p>I have been a memeber of the United States Air Force for 13 years. I started out as an Aircraft Armament Systems Technician. 
            Or "Weapons Loader and Maintainer" for short. I have had the pleasure of working on the fifth generation F-22A Raptor. As well as 
            the F-16C Fighting Falcon and the Remotely Piloted Aircraft the MQ-9 Reaper.
            After a 10 year career doing that I retrained into Cyber Based Intelligence for the Air National Guard of Washington State.
            Then I most recently retrained again to become and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician. Which I currently do now at Nellis AFB, NV.
            I have had the pleasure of traveling all over the world during my time to include Korea, Japan, and Kuwait.
            I am currently enrolled full time at the University of Advancing Technology studying Artifical Intelligence.
            I enjoy being outdoors most of time. I like to camp, hunt, and fish.</p>
