            Technical Field:<br>
            My project encompasses the technical fields of computer programming, A.I., digital art, and
            mobile app development.<br>

            Background Information: 
            <p>I am pursuing this project for a few different reasons. First is that I want to be able help newer 
            players understand the game, create characters with ease, and be able to have everything they need 
            right in front of them. Secondly, I want to give both new and veteran players as well as dungeon masters 
            an all-encompassing app for their use rather than having to constantly manage multiple apps for their games. 
            Lastly, I want to be able to give the dungeon masters an all-encompassing app that allows them to manage combat, 
            encounters, magical items, and the like. This will take some weight off their shoulders and allow them to better 
            manage the game they are running.</p>

            Prior Art (legal term): 
            <p>While there are a hand full of other apps that do one or two things such as encounter management or item 
                generation the only two real competitors are D&amp;D Beyond and PrismScroll's app Prism. Both have decent 
                functionality with the ability to manage campaigns for Dungeon Masters, create characters and view item/spell lists. 
                However, many of the features are hidden behind a paywall, meaning that you must buy additional access or purchase 
                a subscription in order to utilize all the features. Whereas my app will be a onetime fee for access to everything 
                a player or DM would need. The user friendliness of Prism is mediocre at best. Along with the off-putting color scheme 
                the app is rather confusing for first time users and is one of the main reasons I found that would turn others away from it. 
                D&amp;D Beyond is the official app of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. However, I also found the app a little confusing at first. 
                Many of the features of this app are hidden behind paywalls as well. They do provide basic rules for character creation 
                and game mechanics, however anything beyond that requires purchase of specific books or subscriptions. Neither of these 
                apps utilize A.I. in any way. My app will leverage A.I. to assist in character creation, background story, narration, 
                settings, NPC generation, and many other things to make it easier for players and DMs alike to enjoy the game.</p>
            
            Project Description: 
            <p>This project will create an all-in-one style app that will be easy to use for both new and veteran players and DMs. 
                It will help new players learn the basics of the game quickly, create characters with ease and on the fly while 
                helping veteran players play out their perfect character or campaign. It will assist DMs in managing the campaign and 
                all the aspects such as loot, encounters, story arch, etc.</p>

            Claim: 
            <p>This app will create an all-in-one source for both new and veteran players and dungeon masters. It will leverage the 
                use of current A.I. technology that will assist in character creation, item creation, background stories, story arch, 
                narration, NPC generation, and help bring in new players while also assisting veteran ones hone their skills as players/DMs. 
                This will allow everyone to create new ways to enjoy the game.</p>
            
            Usage Scenario: 
            <p>The target demographic for this application would be any person who is new to the game Dungeons &amp; Dragons. This application 
                is designed for the players who have never played the game but are wanting to get into it. Due to the style of this app, 
                veteran players will also benefit from the usage of an all-in-one app for all things D&amp;D, to include simplified rules, 
                lists of class and subclass, spells, weapons and gear, etc. The app will give new players the confidence they need to join 
                a campaign of veteran players or create their own party to play the game. The app will publish as a desktop application first,
                then be converted to a mobile and web-based application. This will easily target the over 50 million players of D&amp;D.</p>
            
            Evaluation Criteria:<br>
            User Interface:
            <li>Does the UI run smooth and is intuitive for the user?</li>
            <li>Do the buttons respond accurately without errors?</li>
            <li>Do the corresponding buttons match with the corresponding information?</li>
            <li>Is the A.I. able to accurately respond to inquiries about all things according to the Open-Source Info?</li>
            Information Collection:
            <li>Is the information up to date according to the latest D&amp;D Open-Source Info?</li>
            Objectives and Tasks Associated with the Project:<br>
            Goal: Create working UI prototype of all-in-one app for Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br>
            Objective 1: Create App Development Environment.
            <li>Utilize Python, Django, Open A.I., and Local LLM.</li>
            Objective 2: Create layout for User Interface
            <li>Design general layout of app and buttons. I.E. Spells, Classes, Etc.</li>
            <li>Design art for user interface.</li>
            <li>Code buttons for general usage before imputing D&amp;D information.</li>
            Objective 3: Code User Interface
            <li>Input D&amp;D information into Python Code</li>
            <br>
            Description of Design Prototype:
            <p>After researching and interacting with my competition's apps, my main goal for design is user friendliness. 
                The design layout of the D&amp;D Beyond app is substantially better than that of the Prism app. My design will 
                mimic some of that user friendliness so new players can easily navigate the app to where they want to go. 
                The app will first run on desktop as a stand alone application. From there it will be converted to run on both iOS and Android. 
                However, I am going to first create the app for desktop. The reason being is that I am more comfortable with Python over React-Native
                and will be able to reach a very broad target market in the first iteration of app creation. Follow-on interations will be web-based and 
                mobile based. Upon clicking or tapping the app icon, which will be a Cauldron, the user will be greeted with a selection menu. 
                They will be able to choose player or DM and from there they will have access to either a player's area or DM area. 
                These areas will have all the open-source information, simplified wherever possible, rules, character sheets, etc. 
                based on if they are a player or DM. The layout will have different section icons on the bottom with a search bar on top. 
                Players/DMs will be able to easily navigate through the app and find the items/rules/creatures/etc. they are looking for. 
                The font and text will lean more toward Viking style writing over the original D&amp;D font style.</p>

            <mark>Updates as of 5 November 2023:</mark>
            <br>
            <mark>Evaluation Plan:</mark>
            <p>I have fully recovered from the hard crash that I experienced in SIP 408. However, I decided to make a web-based application
                written in Python and using Django over React-Native. The limited time that was alloted made learning React-Native an uphill battle,
                so I decided to go with a programming language I am more comfortable with, Python. In two days I was able to full build the running A.I.
                web-based application from the ground up. 
            </p>
            
            <mark>Project Completion Assessment:</mark>
            <p>As of right now, my project has enough functionality to showcase the innovation of the A.I. Right now, the AI and the app
                itself are web-based. My next milestones are to create a local AI, and turn the web-based application into a desktop application
                that will use my own local AI instead of having to utilize APIs. From there I can work on creating the rest of the Character Creation, 
                and other pages to make my first production ready version.
            </p>
