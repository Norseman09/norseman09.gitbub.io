            Last Updated: 09/16/2023 <br>
            Technical Field:<br>
            My project encompasses the technical fields of computer programming, A.I., digital art, and
            mobile app development.<br>

            Background Information: 
            <p>I am pursuing this project for a few different reasons. First is that I want to be able
            help newer players understand the game, create characters with ease, and be able to have everything they need right
            in front of them. Secondly, I want to give both new and veteran players as well as dungeon masters an all encompassing 
            app for their use rather than having to constanly manage multiple apps for their games. Lastly, I want to be able to give
            the dungeon masters an all encompassing app that allows them to manage comabt, encounters, magical items, and the like. 
            This will take some weight off their shoulders and allow them to better manage the game they are running.</p>

            Prior Art (legal term): 
            <p>While there are a hand full of other apps that do one or 
            two things such as encounter management or item generation the only two 
            real competitors are D&amp;D Beyond and PrismScroll's
            app Prism. Both have decent functionality with the ability to manage campaigns for 
            Dungeon Masters, create characters and view item/spell lists. However, many of the features 
            are hidden behind a paywall, meaning that you have to buy additional access or purchase a subcription
            in order to utilize all the features. Whereas, my app will be a one time fee for access to everything 
            a player or DM would need. The user friendliness of Prism is medicore at best. Along with the offputting
            color scheme the app is rather confusing for first time uers and is one of the main reasons I found that 
            would turn others away from it. D&amp;D Beyond is the offical app of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. However, I also
            found the app a litte confusing at first. Many of the features of this app is hidden behind paywalls as well.
            They do provide basic rules for character creation and game mechanics, however anything beyond that requires purchase
            of specific books or subscriptions. Netiher of these apps utilize A.I. in any way. My app will leverage A.I. to assist 
            in character creation, background story, narration, settings, NPC generation, and many other things to make it easier for 
            players and DMs alike to enjoy the game.</p>
            
            Project Description: 
            <p>This project will create an all-in-one style app that will be easy to use for both new and
            veteran players and DMs. It will help new players learn the basics of the game
            quickly, create characters with ease and on the fly while helping veteran players 
            play out their perfect character or campaign. It will assist DMs in managing the campaign 
            and all the aspects such as loot, encounters, story arch, etc.</p>

            Claim: 
            <p>This app will create an all-in-one source for both new and veteran players and dungeon
            masters. It will leverage the use of current A.I. technology that will assist in 
            character creation, item creation, background stories, story arch, narration, NPC
            generation, and help bring in new players while also assisting veteran ones hone their 
            skills as players/DMs. This will allow everyone to create new ways to enjoy the game.</p>
            
            Usage Scenario: 
            <p>The target demographic for this application would be any person who is new to the game of 
            Dungeons &amp; Dragons. This application is designed for the players who have never 
            played the game but are wanting to get into it. Due to the style of this app, 
            veteran players will also benefit from the usage of an all-in-one app for all things 
            D&amp;D, to include simplified rules, lists of class and subclass, spells, weapons and gear, etc. 
            The app will give new players the confidence they need to join a campaign of veteran players 
            or create their own party to play the game. The app will publish on both iOS and Android
            to reach both sides of the smart phone isle with a web based browser in the future. This will 
            easily target the over 50 million players of D&amp;D.</p>
            
            Evaluation Criteria:<br>
            User Interface:
            <li>Does the UI run smooth and is intuitive for the user?</li>
            <li>Do the buttons respond accurately without errors?</li>
            <li>Do the corresponding buttons match with the corresponding information?</li>
            <li>Is the A.I. able to accurately respond with inquires about all things accoring to the Open-Source Info?</li>
            Information Collection:
            <li>Is the information up to date according to the latest D&amp;D Open-Source Info?</li>
            Objectives and Tasks Associated with the Project:<br>
            Goal: Create working UI prototype of all-in-one app for Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br>
            Objective 1: Create App Development Environment.
            <li>Utilize React Native and Expo Go.</li>
            Objective 2: Create layout for User Interface
            <li>Design general layout of app and buttons. I.E. Spells, Classes, Etc.</li>
            <li>Design art for user interface.</li>
            <li>Code buttons for general usage before imputing D&amp;D information.</li>
            Objective 3: Code User Interface
            <li>Input D&amp;D information into React Code</li>
            <br>
            Description of Design Prototype:
            <p>After researching and interacting with my competition's apps, my main goal for design is user friendliness. 
            The design layout of the D&amp;D Beyond app is substantially better than that of the Prism app. My design will
            mimic some of that user friendliness so new players can easily navigate the app to where they want to go. 
            The app will run on both iOS and Android; however, I am going to first create the app for iOS. The reason 
            being is that I will be able to reach a broader target market in the first iteration of app creation. It seems 
            that more people, in my experience, possess an iPhone over an Android phone. Upon clicking or tapping the app 
            icon, which will be a Cauldron, the user will be greeted with a selection menu. They will be able to choose 
            player or DM and from there they will have access to either a player's area or DM area. These areas will have 
            all the open-source information, simplified wherever possible, rules, character sheets, etc. based on if they 
            are a player or DM. The layout will have different section icons on the bottom with a search bar on top. Players/DMs
            will be able to easily navigate through the app and find the items/rules/creatures/etc. they are looking for. 
            The font and text will lean more toward a Viking style writing over the original D&amp;D font style.</p>
            
            Evaluation Plan:
            <p>Now that I have configured React Native an Expo Go to run the app itself, my next task at hand it to create the basic layout
            of the app UI. For this I will hand sketch a basic idea of what I have in mind and then create it using React. Once I can get the basic
            layout done the next main task at hand is to incorporate the A.I. API that I have chosen for this project. Before I add any of the D&amp;D 
            information, my goal is to get a basic functionality done of the selection and player areas first. Once that is running smooth I can add 
            the more complicated features to the app as well as the open-source information.</p>
            
            <!--Project Completion Assessment:
            <p>Provide an in-depth description of the completion assessment of your project. Describe how well the completed 
            components function and highlight the innovative facets of your design. This is sometimes known as a Post-Mortem 
            or Lessons-Learned Report. A good approach for this section is to answer the following 4 questions: What went right? 
            What went wrong? What was learned throughout the process? What would be done differently if you had to do it again?</p>-->
